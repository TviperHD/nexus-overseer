### Issue 2: Advanced Panel Customization Complexity
**Mitigation:** Use proven libraries (`react-resizable-panels`, `dnd-kit`), test frequently

### Issue 3: Dual-AI Coordination
**Mitigation:** Clear separation of responsibilities, queue system, extensive testing

### Issue 4: Performance with Many Panels/Tabs
**Mitigation:** Virtual rendering, lazy loading, optimization strategies documented

### Issue 5: Multi-Window State Sync
**Mitigation:** Centralized state, Tauri events, careful state management

**All issues have documented mitigations.**

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Final review complete
2. ⏳ Create task-based checklist for project setup tasks
   - Create Tauri project
   - Set up development environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Create project structure
   - Make minor implementation decisions (UI library, etc.)

---

## Notes

- All planning documents are comprehensive and implementation-ready
- Minor TBD items are implementation details, not blockers
- Discussion documents can be kept for reference or archived
- The project is well-planned and ready to begin development
