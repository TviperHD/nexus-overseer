# Nexus Overseer

**Status:** Planning  
**Type:** PC Application  
**Created:** 2024-12-28

## Overview

Nexus Overseer is an AI-powered desktop coding assistant that improves upon tools like Cursor by implementing a dual-AI system: an Overseer AI that manages project research, documentation, and task scheduling, and an Implementation AI that writes code directly to desktop files. The application uses free local LLMs to ensure privacy and offline functionality, with a focus on making the AI coding experience smoother and more reliable.

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Planning

We've completed the research phase and are now in detailed planning. All critical systems have been researched and technical specifications created:

**Completed Research:**
- ✅ Framework selection (Tauri chosen)
- ✅ Local LLM integration (Ollama chosen)
- ✅ Code editor integration (Monaco Editor chosen)
- ✅ UI capabilities (resizable panels, multi-window)
- ✅ Dual-AI architecture design
- ✅ Task scheduler system design

**Completed Specifications:**
- ✅ All 11 technical specifications created and updated
- ✅ Feasibility research complete (all features feasible)
- ✅ Implementation roadmap created (6 phases, MVP in 4-6 weeks)
- ✅ All implementation decisions made (UI library, persistence, state storage)

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Complete framework and technology research (Tauri selected)
2. ✅ Design initial technical architecture
3. ✅ Create specification standards document
4. ✅ Create all 11 technical specifications
5. ✅ Review and refine specifications (updated for UI design)
6. ✅ Complete feasibility research (all features feasible)
7. ✅ Create implementation roadmap
8. ✅ Final review complete (all planning ready)
9. ✅ Complete verification (everything 100% ready)
10. ✅ Implementation folder and rules created
11. ⏳ Begin Phase 0: Project Setup

## Key Decisions

- **Project Codename:** Nexus Overseer (2024-12-28)
- **Platform:** PC Desktop Application (not web-based) (2024-12-28)
- **LLM Strategy:** Free local LLMs (privacy-focused, offline-capable) (2024-12-28)
- **Architecture:** Dual-AI system (Overseer AI + Implementation AI) (2024-12-28)

## Notes

- This is a personal project focused on improving the AI coding assistant experience
- Goal is to address common issues with existing tools like Cursor
- Mobile app is a future consideration, not initial priority
- Project scope is large - timeline is flexible
- Focus on making AI code writing directly to desktop files smoother and more reliable
- Overseer AI should handle project-level concerns (research, documentation, task management)
- Implementation AI should focus on actual code generation and file writing
